# Game Automation

A simple Python script that automates the 2048 game on a web browser. 

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
The project still needs a few optimisations and the heuristic function needs a little improvement.

To run the project follow the following steps: 
1) Open 2048 game in browser
2) Run trial_5.py
